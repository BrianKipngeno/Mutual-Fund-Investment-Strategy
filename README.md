# Mutual-Fund-Investment-Strategy

**Project Overview **

Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other securities managed by professional fund managers. This project outlines the steps to create a long-term mutual fund plan using historical stock data.

**Key Steps:**

1. Data Collection: Gathering historical stock prices to analyze trends.
   
2. Risk and Return Analysis:
   
- Calculating ROI to evaluate historical growth.
  
- Measuring volatility to assess investment risks.
  
3. Stock Selection: Filtering stocks with high ROI and low volatility.
   
4. Portfolio Optimization:
   
- Allocating investments based on the Inverse Volatility Ratio.
  
- Prioritizing stability while balancing risk and reward.
  
5. Simulating Returns: Estimating the future value of investments over various periods.

ðŸ“Š **Key Features and Insights**

1. **Historical Data Analysis**

Analyzed historical stock prices from the Nifty 50 dataset.

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to address missing values using forward-fill imputation.

2. **Volatility and ROI Calculation**
   
Volatility: Measured the standard deviation of stock prices to identify high-risk companies.

ROI: Calculated the percentage change between the initial and final stock prices.

3. **Stock Selection Strategy**
   
Criteria: Selected stocks with ROI greater than the median and volatility lower than the median.

Investment Allocation: Assigned weights using the Inverse Volatility Ratio to prioritize stable investments.

4. **Portfolio Analysis**
   
Compared the risk and expected returns of the mutual fund portfolio to high-growth companies.

Visualized trade-offs between risk and reward for different stock groups.

5.** Simulating Returns**

Estimated returns for investments of $1,000/month over 1, 3, 5, and 10 years using compounding principles.

Demonstrated the long-term benefits of a low-risk mutual fund strategy
